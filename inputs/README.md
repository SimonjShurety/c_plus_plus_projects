1 - Create new void function
2 - Copy code into new function
3 - Call new function in place of copied code
4 - Insert argument declarations of used variables into new function
5 - look which variables are used after the function
AND
are changed in the function (if this is more than one ... call sijmen.)
6 - Return this(see 5) variable if any. (and change the return type of the function accordingly)
7 - Change the call to the new function to now also update the value of this(see 5) variable.
e.g. SubtractTen(myBool, myVar); becomes: myVar = SubtractTen(myBool, myVar); (where myvar was found in point 5)
